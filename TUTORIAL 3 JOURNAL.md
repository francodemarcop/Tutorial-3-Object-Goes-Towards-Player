# **TUTORIAL 3 - Journal**

## 05/11/19
My third tutorial uses some assests from previous tutorials as the player's movement and the spawner, the objects we previously created would keep spawning but now they are going towards the player so you will need to avoid them. This objects must disspear once they hit the character or the main camera behind him.
